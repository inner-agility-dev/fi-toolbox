## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

| Layer              | Tool / Framework          | Why It Was Chosen |
|--------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| CLI Framework      | **Oclif** (TypeScript)    | Scalable, plugin-friendly, file-based routing, good TypeScript support |
| Runtime Language   | **TypeScript**            | Safer dev, great LLM compatibility, strongly typed |
| DB Client          | **Knex.js**               | Chainable, readable queries, works well with JSON schema abstraction |
| Config Format      | **JSON**                  | Human + LLM-friendly, declarative, extensible |
| Database           | **PostgreSQL**            | Reliable, relational, introspectable |
| Environment Config | **dotenv**                | Simple DB connection and environment switching |
| Package Scripts    | **npm scripts**           | Easily portable, CLI tested locally |
| Testing Framework  | *(To be added: Vitest or Jest)* | For validation of loaders and DB behavior |

## ðŸ’¡ AI + Dev Agent Friendliness

- âœ… Knex.js is better than raw SQL for LLMs (chainable syntax, less ambiguity)
- âœ… JSON schema abstraction maps naturally to prompt-based tooling
- âœ… Oclif structure is modular and discoverable
- âœ… All TypeScript, so strongly typed end-to-end

---

## ðŸ“¦ Deployment Targets (Stretch Goals)

- Optional publish to private NPM registry
- Use as internal devtool in CI/CD
- Potential MCP integration later for AI schema wiring

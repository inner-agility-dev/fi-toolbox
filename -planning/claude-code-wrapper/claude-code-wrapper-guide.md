# Claude Code Wrapper - Project Guide

## üîç Overview

A powerful tool that wraps around Claude Code ‚Äî not just to extend its capabilities, but to **transform prompt-writing into a persistent, intelligent, and reusable developer experience**.

### Core Features

* **Prompt Enhancement** ‚Äî Automatically improves raw prompts
* **Prompt Discovery** ‚Äî Finds similar existing prompts based on new input
* **Prompt Memory** ‚Äî Every prompt becomes part of a long-term, searchable backend store
* **Prompt Curation** ‚Äî Selectively promote and reuse effective prompts as part of your toolkit

> Creating a **semantic memory layer** for working with Claude Code, making it a more effective and consistent coding partner.

## ‚úÖ Selected Project Description

Adds a developer-friendly memory and review layer on top of Claude Code. Every raw input, enhancement, and response is logged into a persistent timeline. You can replay, refine, compare, and selectively promote prompts into a reusable library.

## üå± Core Value Proposition

**Enhance, remember, and reuse every Claude prompt ‚Äî like giving your coding assistant a second brain.**

## ‚úçÔ∏è Messaging Options

### Clear and Focused
A companion layer for Claude Code that captures every prompt you write, enhances it with smart context, and stores it in a persistent, searchable archive ‚Äî so your best ideas are never lost and always ready to reuse.

### Thoughtful and Practical
Turn every Claude prompt into part of a growing knowledge base. This tool enriches your inputs, lets you search your full prompt history, and curate a reusable collection of high-quality, tested prompts ‚Äî all without breaking your flow.

### Bold and Aspirational
Your prompt work is creative work. This wrapper makes sure none of it goes to waste ‚Äî every prompt becomes part of a living, evolving workspace where you can review, refine, and build your own personal AI playbook.

### Technical but User-Friendly
A structured layer around Claude Code that logs, enhances, and categorizes every interaction. Search across your history, resurface patterns, and build a trusted library of prompt solutions ‚Äî purpose-built for developers who don't want to start from scratch every time.

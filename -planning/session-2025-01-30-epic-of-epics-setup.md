# Session Resume: Epic of Epics GitHub Project Creation
**Date**: January 30, 2025
**Last Action**: Attempting to create Epic-of-Epics GitHub Project
**Blocker**: GitHub token permissions for project creation

## Quick Context
We successfully completed the Git foundation setup:
- ✅ Pushed to both repositories (inner-agility-dev and lennylmiller)
- ✅ Created `/gh-auth` command for switching between accounts
- ✅ Tested basic sync workflow

## EXACT NEXT STEP TO RESUME

### Create the Epic-of-Epics GitHub Project

**Problem**: The `gh` CLI token doesn't have `project` scope. The orchestr8r-mcp MCP server should handle this with its own token.

**Solution Options**:
1. Check if orchestr8r-mcp is properly configured in Claude Desktop with project permissions
2. Or update your GitHub token to include project scopes

**The exact command we need to run** (once permissions are sorted):
```javascript
// Using orchestr8r-mcp MCP command
mcp__orchestr8r-mcp__create-project({
  ownerId: "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzYwNQ==",  // Your GitHub user ID
  title: "FI-Toolbox: Epic of Epics",
  repositoryId: null,  // Not linking to a specific repo
  teamId: null         // Not linking to a team
})
```

## Full Task List for Epic-of-Epics Setup

1. **Create the Project** (BLOCKED - need to fix permissions)
   - Name: "FI-Toolbox: Epic of Epics"
   - Description: "Meta-orchestration system managing the complete development lifecycle - including its own"

2. **Add Custom Fields** (waiting on project creation)
   - 360SOT Document (URL field)
   - Component (Single Select): Git-Sync, 360SOT, CLI, Documentation, Integration
   - Confidence Score (Number field)

3. **Create Initial Epics**:
   - Git Foundation & Sync Workflow
   - 360SOT Document System
   - CLI Core Implementation
   - Component Integration (FRVPOV, prompt-runner, etc.)
   - Self-Management Bootstrap

4. **Design 360SOT Document Format** (can do in parallel)
   - Create template with YAML frontmatter
   - Include GitHub sync metadata
   - Test with this very document

5. **Create 360SOT Viewer** (after format design)
   - Simple bash script: `fitb view`, `fitb status`, `fitb sync`

## To Resume Next Session

1. Start by reading this file: `/Users/LenMiller/code/banno/fi-toolbox/-planning/session-2025-01-30-epic-of-epics-setup.md`
2. Check orchestr8r-mcp MCP server configuration in Claude Desktop
3. Attempt to create the Epic-of-Epics project
4. If blocked, fix token permissions first

## Command to Check Status
```bash
# Check current branch and sync status
git branch -vv

# Check GitHub auth
gh auth status

# List current projects (to verify permissions)
gh api graphql -f query='{ viewer { projectsV2(first: 5) { nodes { title } } } }'
```

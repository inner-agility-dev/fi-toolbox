# Responsive Tiles Architecture

This document provides a detailed explanation of the architectural decisions, patterns, and design principles used in the Responsive Tiles application.

## High-Level Architecture

Responsive Tiles is built with a modular architecture that emphasizes:

1. **Component-Based Design**: Reusable UI components with clear responsibilities
2. **Store-Based State Management**: Domain-driven state organization using MobX
3. **Dual-Mode Operation**: Support for both full app mode and standalone tile mode
4. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and device capabilities
5. **White-Label Support**: Customizable theming and configuration

The application follows a modified flux architecture pattern, with unidirectional data flow and centralized state management.

## Modular Tiles Architecture

The core architectural concept of Responsive Tiles is the "tile" - a self-contained, embeddable UI component that provides specific functionality.

### Tile Structure

Each tile consists of:

- **Container Component**: Manages the tile's state and lifecycle
- **Presentation Components**: Render the UI based on the current state
- **Store Integration**: Connects to domain-specific data stores
- **Route Configuration**: Internal routing for tile navigation

### Tile Registry

Tiles are registered in a central registry (`src/tiles.js`), which allows them to be:

1. Created dynamically at runtime
2. Embedded in external applications
3. Configured through a standardized API
4. Mounted to arbitrary DOM elements

```javascript
// Example of tile registration and creation
const registry = {
  createBudgetsTile: (el, config) => {
    return createTile(el, 'budgets', BudgetsTile, config);
  },
  createNetWorthTile: (el, config) => {
    return createTile(el, 'networth', NetWorthTile, config);
  },
  // ...other tiles
};
```

### Tile Lifecycle

Tiles follow a specific lifecycle:

1. **Initialization**: Configuration is validated and processed
2. **Mounting**: Tile is rendered to the specified DOM element
3. **State Management**: Internal state is managed independently
4. **Communication**: Events are emitted for external integration
5. **Unmounting**: Clean up and resource release

## Store-Based State Management

Responsive Tiles uses MobX for state management, organized around domain-specific stores.

### Store Organization

Stores are organized by feature domain, following a pattern of:

```
src/stores/
├── accountsStore/     # Accounts management
├── budgetsStore/      # Budget tracking
├── cashflowStore/     # Cash flow analysis
├── contextStore/      # Application context
├── goalsStore/        # Financial goals
├── netWorthStore/     # Net worth tracking
├── notificationsStore/# User notifications
├── spendingStore/     # Spending analytics
├── tagsStore/         # Transaction tagging
└── transactionsStore/ # Transaction management
```

Each store directory typically contains:
- `index.js`: Main store implementation
- Feature-specific components that are tightly coupled with the store
- Helper files and utilities

### Store Implementation Pattern

Stores follow a consistent implementation pattern:

```javascript
// Example of a typical store structure
class TransactionsStore {
  // Observable state
  @observable transactions = [];
  @observable isLoading = false;
  @observable filters = new Filters();
  
  // Computed values
  @computed get filteredTransactions() {
    // Filter logic
  }
  
  // Actions
  @action loadTransactions = async () => {
    this.isLoading = true;
    try {
      const data = await api.getTransactions();
      runInAction(() => {
        this.transactions = data;
      });
    } catch (error) {
      // Error handling
    } finally {
      this.isLoading = false;
    }
  }
  
  // Other methods
}
```

### Store Communication

Stores communicate with each other through:

1. **Direct References**: Stores can import and reference other stores
2. **Context Provider**: Shared context for application-wide state
3. **Event System**: Custom event emitters for cross-store notifications

## Component Organization

Components are organized into several categories:

### Common Components (`src/components/common/`)

Reusable UI components that are not tied to specific business logic:
- Form controls
- Layout components
- Data visualization
- Feedback components

### Tile Components (`src/components/tiles/`)

Feature-specific components that implement individual tiles:
- Budget tile
- Net worth tile
- Spending analysis tile
- Cash flow tile

### App Components (`src/components/`)

Components for the full application experience:
- App container
- Navigation
- Dashboard layout
- Authentication screens

### Component Composition

Components are composed using:

1. **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**: For cross-cutting concerns
2. **Render Props**: For component composition with state sharing
3. **Context**: For deeply nested component state access
4. **Material-UI Theming**: For consistent styling

```javascript
// Example of component composition
const EnhancedComponent = withWidth(
  withStyles(styles)(
    inject('transactionsStore')(
      observer(MyComponent)
    )
  )
);
```

## Routing Strategy

Responsive Tiles uses React Router with a dual-mode routing strategy:

### App Mode Routing

In full application mode, routing uses `BrowserRouter` to enable browser history navigation:

```javascript
// App routing (simplified)
<BrowserRouter>
  <Switch>
    <Route path="/dashboard" component={Dashboard} />
    <Route path="/accounts" component={Accounts} />
    <Route path="/transactions" component={Transactions} />
    <Route path="/budgets" component={Budgets} />
    {/* Other routes */}
  </Switch>
</BrowserRouter>
```

### Tile Mode Routing

In tile mode, routing uses `MemoryRouter` to keep routing self-contained within the tile:

```javascript
// Tile routing (simplified)
<MemoryRouter>
  <Switch>
    <Route path="/" exact component={TileMain} />
    <Route path="/detail/:id" component={TileDetail} />
    <Route path="/edit/:id" component={TileEdit} />
    {/* Other internal routes */}
  </Switch>
</MemoryRouter>
```

### Route Definition

Routes are defined in a centralized `routes.js` file, which supports both app and tile mode:

```javascript
export const getRoutes = (isApp = true) => {
  const routes = [
    {
      path: '/dashboard',
      component: Dashboard,
      exact: true,
      title: 'Dashboard'
    },
    // Other routes
  ];
  
  return isApp ? routes : filterTileRoutes(routes);
};
```

## API Integration

The application integrates with backend services through a centralized API layer.

### API Client

API requests are handled through a consistent client interface:

```javascript
// src/api/index.js
export const getTransactions = (params) => 
  client.get('/transactions', { params });

export const updateTransaction = (id, data) => 
  client.put(`/transactions/${id}`, data);

// ...other API methods
```

### Authentication

API requests include authentication via:

1. **JWT Tokens**: Sent in Authorization header
2. **Session Handling**: Automatic refreshing of tokens
3. **Error Handling**: Consistent handling of auth errors

### Data Fetching Pattern

Data fetching follows a consistent pattern:

1. Set loading state to true
2. Make API request with error handling
3. Process and normalize response data
4. Update store state with normalized data
5. Set loading state to false

### Mock Data

For development and testing, the application supports mock data:

```javascript
// src/api/data/transactions.js
export const mockTransactions = [
  {
    id: '1',
    amount: 50.00,
    description: 'Coffee Shop',
    date: '2025-04-01',
    // ...other fields
  },
  // ...more mock data
];
```

## Error Handling

The application implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

1. **API Error Handling**: Consistent handling of API errors
2. **UI Error Boundaries**: React error boundaries to prevent cascading failures
3. **Error Reporting**: Integration with Sentry for error tracking
4. **User Feedback**: Appropriate user-facing error messages

## Configuration System

The application supports extensive configuration:

1. **Environment Variables**: For deployment-specific settings
2. **Partner Configuration**: For white-labeling and partner-specific behavior
3. **Feature Flags**: For enabling/disabling features
4. **Theme Configuration**: For UI customization

## Performance Considerations

Key architectural decisions for performance include:

1. **Memoization**: Using React.memo and useCallback/useMemo for expensive operations
2. **Virtualization**: For efficient rendering of large lists
3. **Lazy Loading**: Code splitting for route-based component loading
4. **Selective Rendering**: MobX's fine-grained reactivity system

## Security Considerations

The architecture incorporates several security measures:

1. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of user inputs
2. **JWT Security**: Secure handling of authentication tokens
3. **Authorization Checks**: Consistent permission checks
4. **Content Security Policy**: Secure content loading
5. **XSS Prevention**: Security practices to prevent cross-site scripting

## Conclusion

The Responsive Tiles architecture is designed to be:

- **Modular**: Easy to extend with new features
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Performant**: Optimized for real-world usage
- **Flexible**: Adaptable to different integration scenarios
- **Secure**: Following best practices for web security

This architectural approach allows for efficient development, testing, and extension of the application while maintaining a high-quality user experience.

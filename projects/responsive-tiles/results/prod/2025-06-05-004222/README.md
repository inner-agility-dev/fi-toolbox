**A modular, responsive system for financial data visualization and management**

</div>

## üìã Overview

Responsive Tiles is an advanced framework for building modular, embeddable financial UI components. Each "tile" is a self-contained feature that can be independently integrated into any host application while maintaining responsive design principles through our container-based approach.

```mermaid
  graph TD
  A[Host Application] --> B[Container System]
  B --> C[Responsive Tiles]
  C --> D[Data Visualization]
  C --> E[User Interactions]
  C --> F[State Management]

  B --> G[ContextStore]
  G --> H[Responsive Layout]

  C --> J[Financial Features]
  J --> K[Accounts]
  J --> L[Budgets]
  J --> M[Spending Analysis]
  J --> N[Goals]
```

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Container-Based Responsiveness**: Class components adapt to their container context via MobX observables
- **Modular Architecture**: Independent, self-contained tiles for each financial feature
- **MobX State Management**: Reactive state updates with efficient store architecture
- **Comprehensive Testing Tools**: Built-in Toolbox and Test Harness for development
- **Production-Ready CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipeline for multiple environments
- **Accessibility Focused**: WCAG 2.1 compliant components that adapt to user preferences
- **Code Validation**: Type checking during PR validation for improved code quality
- **Theming Support**: Customizable appearance to match any brand identity

## üîÑ Release Process

Responsive Tiles follows a trunk-based development approach with automated deployments. As a developer, you need to perform these steps to create a release:

```bash
# Ensure you're on the master branch with latest changes
git checkout master
git pull

# Update version (choose one based on changes)
npm version patch -m "Bump version to %s"  # For bug fixes
# OR
npm version minor -m "Bump version to %s"  # For new features
# OR
npm version major -m "Bump version to %s"  # For breaking changes

# Push changes with tags
git push && git push --tags
```

This will:
1. Update the version in package.json
2. Create a commit with the version change
3. Create a git tag with the version
4. Trigger the CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy to all environments

For detailed information on the complete release process, see [Release Process Documentation](docs/deployment/release-process.md).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >=20.18.0 <21 (as specified in package.json)
- npm 9+

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Banno/responsive-tiles.git
cd responsive-tiles

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8080/
```

### Testing

Run Playwright tests with:

```bash
# Run all Playwright tests
npm test

# Run tests in UI mode
npm run playwright:test:local

# Run tests for specific environments
npm run playwright:test:development
npm run playwright:test:staging
npm run playwright:test:production
```

Learn more about [Test Tools](docs/architecture/testing/test-tools.md).

## üì¶ Deployment

Responsive Tiles uses a multi-environment deployment strategy through GitHub Actions workflows:

- **PR Validation**: Automated testing on PR creation with immediate feedback
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching for faster builds (50-70% improvement)
- **Build Once, Deploy Many**: Single artifact deployed to all environments

### Build and Deployment Process

The deployment pipeline progressively promotes changes through three environments:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "CI/CD Pipeline"
        A[Code Push<br>to Master] --> B[Tests & Build<br>with Caching]
        B --> C[Single<br>Versioned Artifact]
        
        C --> D[Deploy to<br>Development]
        D --> E[Verify<br>Development]
        E --> F[Deploy to<br>Staging]
        F --> G[Verify<br>Staging]
        G --> H[Deploy to<br>Production]
        H --> I[Verify<br>Production]
        I --> J[Deployment<br>Report]
    end
    
    subgraph "PR Validation"
        PR[Pull Request<br>Created] --> Tests[Run Tests<br>& Validations]
        Tests --> Feedback[Results Posted<br>as PR Comments]
    end
```

### Automatic Deployment

Deployments are handled automatically by GitHub Actions workflows when code is merged to the master branch. The deployment process is defined in:

- `.github/workflows/main-deployment.yml` (primary deployment workflow)
- `.github/workflows/reusable-build.yml` (reusable build process)

Manual builds can be initiated with:

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Build documentation
npm run build:docs
```

### Environment Configuration

Each environment uses dedicated Google Cloud Platform buckets:

| Environment | Triggered By | GCP Bucket |
|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Development | Push to master | `dev-digital-gzo-geezeo-tiles-zwwst63n` |
| Staging | Successful dev deployment | `stage-digital-gzo-geezeo-tiles-nyjcof9v` |
| Production | Successful staging deployment | `prod-digital-gzo-geezeo-tiles-gvf7byup` |

For detailed workflow configuration, see [GitHub Workflows Documentation](docs/github-workflows/README.md).

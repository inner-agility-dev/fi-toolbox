# Comparative Analysis of GitHub Actions and GCS Configurations

## Step 1: Analyze Each Implementation

For each of the following directories:
- `-analysis/responsive-tiles-workflows/original/`
- `-analysis/responsive-tiles-workflows/current/`
- `-analysis/responsive-tiles-workflows/new/`

Execute the analysis prompt from `-analysis/responsive-tiles-workflows/-prompts/1.1 - get-gcs-and-github-configuratrions.md`, using the directory as the `WORKFLOW_ROOT_FOLDER` parameter.

## Step 2: Store Results for Comparison

After analyzing each folder, store the **full structured output** in memory using these keys:
- `gcs_github_config_original` for the original implementation
- `gcs_github_config_current` for the current implementation
- `gcs_github_config_new` for the new implementation

> Example (pseudocode):  
> `mcp.memory["gcs_github_config_original"] = [full analysis result for original]`  
> `mcp.memory["gcs_github_config_current"] = [full analysis result for current]`  
> `mcp.memory["gcs_github_config_new"] = [full analysis result for new]`

## Step 3: Comparative Analysis

Once all three analyses are stored, retrieve them and perform a comprehensive comparison. Your report should include:

1. **Configuration Differences Table**  
   - Side-by-side comparison of key parameters (triggers, environments, GCP projects, bucket configurations, etc.)

2. **Workflow Evolution Analysis**  
   - Describe how workflows have changed from original → current → new

3. **GCS Configuration Changes**  
   - Highlight differences in bucket naming, deployment paths, authentication, and project structure

4. **Security and Best Practices Assessment**  
   - Compare security implementations, permissions, and adoption of modern practices

5. **Recommendations**  
   - Summarize improvements, potential issues, and suggested optimizations

Present the final comparison in a structured, easy-to-understand format with clear sections, tables, and bullet points for quick identification of key differences and improvements.

**Note:**  
If you need to reference the stored results, use the memory keys:  
- `gcs_github_config_original`
- `gcs_github_config_current`
- `gcs_github_config_new`

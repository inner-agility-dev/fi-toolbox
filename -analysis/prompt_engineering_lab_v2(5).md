# Pie-In-The-Sky: Prompt Engineering Laboratory
## Research Methodologies and Experimental Approaches

### **Document Purpose**
This is the experimental research document for prompt engineering within the fitb CLI ecosystem. It contains methodologies for testing prompt effectiveness, experimental frameworks for improving AI collaboration, and theoretical approaches to systematic prompt optimization. This informs but doesn't constrain the practical CLI implementation.

## **Research Mission**

### **Core Questions**
1. **Prompt Effectiveness**: Which prompt structures generate the most accurate and useful project analysis?
2. **Collaboration Patterns**: How do you prompt for effective AI-to-AI handoffs and coordination?
3. **Context Optimization**: What's the optimal balance between context richness and prompt clarity?
4. **Learning Systems**: How do you systematically improve prompt quality based on real-world outcomes?
5. **Specialization Design**: How do you create distinct AI "agent" personalities through prompt engineering?

### **Success Criteria**
- **Accuracy**: AI analysis matches human expert analysis >85% of the time
- **Consistency**: Same prompts produce similar quality outputs across different projects
- **Efficiency**: Optimized prompts reduce token usage while maintaining quality
- **Collaboration**: Multi-prompt workflows produce better outcomes than single-prompt approaches
- **Learning**: Prompt effectiveness measurably improves over time through systematic optimization

## **Context Optimization Research**

### **Context Compression Experiments**

#### **Experiment 1: Information Density**
**Hypothesis**: More detailed context improves output quality up to a threshold, beyond which it becomes noise.

**Variables**:
- **Minimal Context**: Project name, framework, basic task description
- **Standard Context**: Above + component inventory, recent changes, team expertise
- **Rich Context**: Above + detailed code structure, performance metrics, accessibility scores
- **Maximum Context**: Above + complete file listings, dependency analysis, historical patterns

**Measurement**: Output quality vs context token usage efficiency

#### **Experiment 2: Context Structure**
**Hypothesis**: Structured context formats improve AI comprehension vs narrative formats.

**Formats**:
```
A. Narrative Format:
"The banno-online project is a React application with 127 components including 89 UI components and 38 utilities. The team has strong frontend expertise and recent work has focused on accessibility improvements..."

B. Structured Format:
Project: banno-online
Framework: React
Components: 127 total (89 UI, 38 utility)
Team Expertise: Frontend, Accessibility
Recent Focus: Accessibility improvements

C. JSON Format:
{
  "project": "banno-online",
  "framework": "react", 
  "components": {"total": 127, "ui": 89, "utility": 38},
  "team": {"expertise": ["frontend", "accessibility"]},
  "recent_focus": ["accessibility_improvements"]
}
```

#### **Experiment 3: Dynamic Context Selection**
**Hypothesis**: AI can learn to request relevant context rather than receiving everything upfront.

**Approach**:
```
Initial Prompt: "You have access to project context. What information do you need to analyze this ticket effectively?"

Follow-up: Provide only requested information and measure outcome quality vs full context approaches.
```

Contextual Variables:
{{COMPONENT_INVENTORY}} - Available UI components
{{ACCESSIBILITY_STANDARDS}} - Required compliance levels
{{TESTING_FRAMEWORK}} - Testing tools and approaches
{{PERFORMANCE_REQUIREMENTS}} - Performance constraints

## **Quality Assurance and Validation**

### **Output Validation Systems**

#### **Automated Quality Checks**
```typescript
interface QualityValidator {
  validateAccuracy(output: PromptOutput, baseline: Baseline): AccuracyScore;
  validateCompleteness(output: PromptOutput, requirements: Requirement[]): CompletenessScore;
  validateSpecificity(output: PromptOutput): SpecificityScore;
  validateConsistency(outputs: PromptOutput[]): ConsistencyScore;
  validateActionability(output: PromptOutput): ActionabilityScore;
}

class AutomatedQualitySystem {
  async validateOutput(output: PromptOutput): Promise<QualityReport> {
    const checks = await Promise.all([
      this.checkForVagueLanguage(output),
      this.checkForActionableSteps(output),
      this.checkForCompleteness(output),
      this.checkForConsistency(output),
      this.checkForAccuracy(output)
    ]);
    
    return {
      overall_score: this.calculateOverallScore(checks),
      specific_issues: checks.flatMap(check => check.issues),
      improvement_suggestions: this.generateImprovements(checks),
      confidence: this.calculateConfidence(checks)
    };
  }
}
```

#### **Human-in-the-Loop Validation**
```
Validation Workflow:
1. AI generates analysis/recommendations
2. Automated quality checks identify potential issues
3. Human reviewer validates high-risk or low-confidence outputs
4. Feedback feeds back into prompt optimization system
5. Validated outputs become part of training dataset

Quality Gates:
- Accuracy Score < 0.7: Requires human review
- Confidence Score < 0.6: Requires human review
- Novel patterns: Requires human review
- High-impact recommendations: Requires human review
```

I need you to analyze the complete Git history of the `.github` folder in this repository. Please:

1. Use Git commands to examine the full commit history that affected the `.github` directory and its contents
2. Show me all commits that added, modified, or deleted files within the `.github` folder
3. For each relevant commit, provide:
   - Commit hash and date
   - Author information
   - Commit message
   - What specific files were changed (added/modified/deleted) in the `.github` directory
4. If the `.github` folder was renamed or moved from another location, trace that history as well
5. Present the results in chronological order (oldest to newest)
6. Include any workflow files, issue templates, pull request templates, or other GitHub-specific configuration files that were part of this history

Use appropriate Git commands like `git log`, `git log --follow`, or `git log --oneline` with path filtering to gather this information comprehensively.

Please provide me with the complete contents and structure of the `.github` folder as it existed in November 2024. Specifically:

1. Use Git commands to check out or examine the repository state during November 2024 (around commits from November 2, 2024)
2. Show the exact directory structure of the `.github` folder at that time
3. List all files that existed within `.github` and its subdirectories during that period
4. For each file, provide:
   - The full file path relative to `.github`
   - The file size or line count
   - A brief description of the file's purpose (especially for workflow files)
5. If there were multiple versions of the `.github` folder during November 2024 due to commits, show the state at the end of November 2024
6. Include the specific commit hash(es) that represent the November 2024 state for reference

Based on our previous analysis, I'm particularly interested in seeing the workflow files that existed before the major simplification that occurred in April-May 2025, as November 2024 appears to be during the period when the repository had the more complex workflow structure with files like `deployment.yml` and the various tiles-specific workflows.

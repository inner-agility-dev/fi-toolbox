Banno Project Management
As a maintenance developer on the responsive-tiles project, you are responsible for ensuring the smooth operation and continuous improvement of the system. Your role involves a combination of maintenance, support, and occasional feature enhancements. Here's what you need to focus on:
Determining if document generation is needed for any given generalized are of need... (for instance RND, PRD, SDLC, etc., MAINTENANCE, etc. but abve that there are categorkes of projects that require a backlog of activities so this tool will need to be able to generate the correct documents for the project type)

For example;

--> migrate a component from Polymer to lit, in some cases, as our component tree's can be vast, there could be 100's of files that need to be updated, in other cases, it could be a single file.  The key is to be able to generate the correct document for the given situation. And it can be generated in such a voice to be partner with generating an inital scoped SCRUM project with a well defined backlog and what entry, i.e. Research proof of concept, etc. or PRD, we've now got a vision for a feature enhancement and will need a RND to MAINTENCE .. 

SCOPE & SCALE: In the Polymer to LIT migration, a larger component having 100 components will for any given component be composed of any number of differnt compnent or re-use existing , so a migrtion plan needs to be generated for each component that is being migrated. An in a small coponent it will be more of a MAINTENANCE task. and will have all the supporting documents and collection made up of pre-existiong prompts that have generated the correct documents for the project type and patterns) .  The main point is, in the early days we'll only have a simple prompt to help us figure out how to.    

As we refine our central store of maturing prompts that live in the fi-toolbox project, we'll have to have a central means to manage and distribute the changes... remember we're maintaining the prompts, and have parameterized prompts that can be used to generate the correct documents for the project type and patterns). 


Another example I'm on Fire Fighting duty and my only priority is to quickly determine, in a triage capacity, whether the issue is a banno-online frontend enginering issue, and as quickly as possible accept or claim or reject the issue, and put a plan in place to resolve the issue and put it in the backlong.

With AI you have a mini SCRUM team with parallization of tasks., and the concept is .... to generate a LARGE SCALE full complment of documents for any given situation that lives in the fi-toolbox project's data store... then for any given project of any type,scope or scale will draw on these documents stored highly search friendly way, and when the first SCRUM project is defined, you'll in less complex terms describe the issue and with assistance of claude via our fitb cli tool, it will generate the correct documents for the project type and patterns). ... And AGAIN these are based on the maturing prompts that live in the fi-toolbox project, and as we add more prompts, we'll be able to generate more and more documents for any given situation.  so basically on DAY 1 we need to be able to quickly regenerate 100% of the HIGHLY SEARCHABLE document store, and re-sync, index, or whatever to ensure we can then turn around and regenerate any open SCRUM projects.   In this tool a SCRUM project is only as long as it takes to get the VISION from RND, Proof of Concept, PRD, SDLC, and into MAINTENANCE. so, the specific GitHub Project draft issues generated for the SCRUM backlog items will be very specific,and have strong and re-usable references to both the source prompt and the generated text... 

As you can see the parrallization goals are going to take a lot of trial and error, and we'll want to refine the parameterized prompts,and after awhile we'll see a library of re-usable prompts that can be used to generate the correct documents for the project type and patterns). ... 

So in the early stages of this ALL of our existint prompts will be suspect, and then after a while we'll see how to optimize it,a nd since we're growing accumstom to always be thinking in terms of fixing generalize templatize prompts the better...

now, with parallization it adds another level of complexiti with how we state, scope, task, critical-path, etc our work, and initially this will mean our plans are all but written code and then these will be wrapped in prompted patterns and eventually it's just small tweeks and extension points.. 


But in the early days.. well your basically FUCKED because every project has a certain degree of upfront hardening of expectations before you can truly own what is your's verusus you were seduced by a AI helucination.

The items in this project that are relative to the CLI tool are HIGHER prioity...

Central location to keep all the prompts in one place

A project has to be 


fi-toolbox.... long term - TODO:
fitb cli:  Tool used in terminal to manage FI configurations, initally it's specific to Responsive-Tiles toolbox features, but in the short term the features that will be supporte

1. Analyze a project
2. Create PRE_REGISTER 
2. Create a PRD
3. Create a SDLC
4. Create a promotion plan
5. Create a testing plan
6. Create a deployment plan
7. Create a monitoring plan
8. Create a support plan
9. Create a retirement plan
10. Create a security plan
11. Create a compliance plan
12. Create a training plan
13. Create a documentation plan 



What I want right away is to maintain all registered projects guiding information.

1. PRE_REGISTER 

FI Toolbox is a Swiss Army knife for managing financial institution configurations. It provides a central hub for all things related to FIs, from initial registration to ongoing support and maintenance.

The strategy used is to initially create a series of documents  which project to PRE_REGISTER


initally create a pre-register set of docs that allow for futur opt-in to work... 


1. GitHub Project using SCRUM Backlog.. So, what can we do to get to the poing of having a Backlog when it's a pre-existing project.  



The Value to the person working on a Banno project will have on hand a group of pre-packaged claude code commnds that cater to a number of pre-defined workflows.  For instance,

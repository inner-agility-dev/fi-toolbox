## **Theoretical Architecture**

### **Agent Coordination Layer**
```typescript
interface AgentCoordinator {
  // High-level task breakdown
  decomposeTask(task: ProjectTask): AgentAssignment[];
  
  // Orchestrate parallel vs sequential execution
  orchestrateExecution(assignments: AgentAssignment[]): ExecutionPlan;
  
  // Manage inter-agent communication
  facilitateHandoff(fromAgent: Agent, toAgent: Agent, context: WorkContext): HandoffResult;
  
  // Resolve conflicts between agent recommendations
  resolveConflicts(conflictingOutputs: AgentOutput[]): Resolution;
  
  // Learn from successful collaborations
  extractPatterns(successfulSessions: CollaborationSession[]): CoordinationPattern[];
}
```

### **Agent Interface Standard**
```typescript
interface SpecializedAgent {
  // Agent identity and capabilities
  specialty: AgentSpecialty;
  capabilities: Capability[];
  expertise_level: ExpertiseLevel;
  
  // Core analysis function
  analyze(context: ProjectContext, task: AgentTask): AnalysisResult;
  
  // Collaboration functions
  reviewPeerWork(peerOutput: AgentOutput): ReviewResult;
  incorporateFeedback(feedback: PeerFeedback): void;
  
  // Learning functions
  learnFromOutcome(outcome: ProjectOutcome): void;
  improveFromFeedback(feedback: UserFeedback): void;
}
```

## **Collaboration Patterns**

### **Pattern: Parallel Analysis with Synthesis**
**Use Case**: Comprehensive project analysis

**Flow**:
1. **Coordinator** decomposes analysis request into specialized aspects
2. **Multiple Agents** analyze simultaneously:
   - Frontend Agent: UI/UX considerations
   - Security Agent: Vulnerability assessment  
   - Performance Agent: Optimization opportunities
   - Accessibility Agent: Compliance review
3. **Synthesis Agent** combines outputs into coherent recommendations
4. **Quality Agent** validates consistency and completeness

**Research Questions**:
- How do you prevent analysis overlap while ensuring complete coverage?
- What synthesis algorithms work best for combining diverse agent perspectives?
- How do you weight conflicting recommendations from different specialties?

### **Pattern: Sequential Refinement Chain**
**Use Case**: Complex implementation planning

**Flow**:
1. **Architecture Agent** creates high-level implementation plan
2. **Frontend Agent** refines UI implementation details
3. **Testing Agent** adds testing strategy and coverage requirements
4. **Security Agent** reviews and adds security considerations
5. **Documentation Agent** creates implementation guide
6. **Quality Agent** validates plan completeness and feasibility

**Research Questions**:
- How do you maintain plan coherence as it passes through multiple agents?
- What information must be preserved vs abstracted at each handoff?
- How do you handle cases where later agents identify fundamental issues?

### **Pattern: Collaborative Iteration**
**Use Case**: Iterative design and feedback

**Flow**:
1. **Frontend Agent** proposes initial component design
2. **Accessibility Agent** reviews and suggests improvements
3. **Frontend Agent** refines design based on feedback
4. **Testing Agent** reviews testability and suggests changes
5. **Frontend Agent** incorporates testing considerations
6. **All Agents** provide final validation

**Research Questions**:
- How many iteration cycles optimize quality vs efficiency?
- How do you prevent infinite feedback loops?
- What termination criteria indicate sufficient quality?

      .filter(s => s.outcome.success_rating > 0.8)
      .map(s => this.analyzeCollaborationFlow(s))
      .reduce(this.identifyCommonPatterns);
  }
  
  // Improve agent specialization
  refineAgentCapabilities(agent: Agent, outcomes: ProjectOutcome[]): Agent {
    const improvements = this.analyzeAgentPerformance(agent, outcomes);
    return this.updateAgentPrompts(agent, improvements);
  }
  
  // Optimize coordination strategies
  improveCoordination(coordinator: AgentCoordinator, metrics: PerformanceMetric[]): AgentCoordinator {

# Git Integration for 360-Degree Source of Truth (360SOT)
## Strategic Use of Commit Logs and Diffs

### Overview
Using commit logs and diffs strategically is one of the most underutilized yet high-signal ways to enrich a 360SOT system. This document outlines how to incorporate version control history into the FI-Toolbox ecosystem.

---

## ‚úÖ Why Git Commit Logs & Diffs Add Value to 360SOT

### 1. **Source of Intent**
- Commit messages often encode the **intent** behind a change ("fix bug", "migrate component", "refactor structure")
- They give a human narrative over time and show the evolution of decisions
- Provides context that code alone cannot convey

### 2. **Change History + Diff Context**
- Diffs provide the **exact shape and scope** of a change
- Useful for tracking recurring patterns:
  - Common migration steps
  - Repeated bugs
  - Architectural evolution
- You can correlate diffs with prompt generations ‚Äî e.g., "what changed after this PRD?"

### 3. **Author/Ownership Metadata**
- Contributors are a proxy for code ownership and useful for assigning context-aware tasks
- Mapping files/modules to frequent committers strengthens prompt specificity
- Helps identify subject matter experts for specific components

## üß† How to Incorporate Git Logs into 360SOT

| Technique | What It Adds | Example Usage |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Semantic Commit Parsing** | Extract purpose, type (feat/fix/refactor), module tags | Use to enrich prompts: "Show PRD changes tied to analytics features" |
| **Temporal Diffs by Feature** | Group file changes over time | Highlight migration waves or SDLC rollouts |
| **Change Density Heatmap** | See which areas are most volatile | Flag as maintenance hotspots or require stricter review |
| **Link Diffs to Documents** | Associate commits with PRD/SDLC/docs | Use to verify document accuracy retrospectively |

## üîß Suggested CLI Addition to fitb

### New Command: `analyze-commits`

```bash
# Scan git log for smart commits to augment 360SOT
fitb analyze-commits --project=banno-online \
  --since="3 months ago" \
  --output=360SOT/git-context.json
```

### Generated JSON Artifact Structure

```json
{
  "project": "banno-online",
  "analysis_period": {
    "start": "2024-10-01",
    "end": "2025-01-01"
  },
  "file_ownership": {
    "src/components/modal.js": {
      "primary_contributors": ["john.doe", "jane.smith"],
      "change_frequency": "high",
      "last_modified": "2024-12-15"
    }
  },
  "commit_patterns": {
    "feature_commits": 234,
    "bug_fixes": 156,
    "refactors": 89,
    "migrations": 12
  },
  "hotspots": [
    {
      "file": "src/utils/api-client.js",
      "changes": 47,
      "contributors": 8,
      "risk_level": "high"
    }
  ],
  "migration_waves": [
    {
      "pattern": "polymer-to-lit",
      "files_affected": 23,
      "commits": 45,
      "timespan": "2024-11-01 to 2024-12-01"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üìä Integration with Existing 360SOT Components

### Enhanced Project Context
```javascript
const enhanced360SOT = {
  // Existing components
  codebase_analysis: { /* ... */ },
  team_context: { /* ... */ },
  
  // NEW: Git-derived intelligence
  version_control_insights: {
    change_velocity: calculateFromCommitFrequency(),
    ownership_map: deriveFromContributors(),
    evolution_patterns: extractFromDiffs(),
    intent_history: parseFromCommitMessages()
  }
};
```

### Pattern Recognition Enhancement
Git data can improve pattern matching confidence:
- If recent commits mention "migration", boost MIGRATION-PATTERN confidence
- If many bug fixes in an area, suggest FIRE-FIGHTER-TRIAGE pattern
- If commits show refactoring activity, consider MAINTENANCE-WORKFLOW

---

## üéØ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Git Analysis
1. Parse commit messages for keywords
2. Map files to contributors
3. Calculate change frequency metrics

### Phase 2: Semantic Understanding
1. Use conventional commit format parsing
2. Extract JIRA/issue references
3. Link commits to documentation updates

### Phase 3: Predictive Intelligence
1. Predict maintenance needs based on change patterns
2. Suggest optimal reviewers based on contribution history
3. Auto-generate context for new tickets based on file history

## üîç Strategic Queries Enabled

With git integration, the 360SOT can answer:

1. **"Who should review changes to the authentication module?"**
   - Check primary contributors to auth-related files

2. **"What's the migration progress for Polymer components?"**
   - Track commits with migration patterns over time

3. **"Which areas need the most maintenance?"**
   - Identify files with high bug-fix commit density

4. **"What was the original intent behind this architecture?"**
   - Trace back through commit messages and PRs

5. **"How long do similar changes typically take?"**
   - Analyze historical commit patterns for estimation

---

## üìù Commit Message Best Practices for 360SOT

To maximize value from git integration:

```
type(scope): subject

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

Example:
```
feat(auth): implement OAuth2 integration

- Added OAuth2 provider support
- Updated user model for external IDs
- Migration script for existing users

JIRA: AUTH-123
Pattern: NEW-FEATURE
Stage: SDLC
```

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Git Webhooks**: Update 360SOT on every push
2. **PR Analysis**: Extract review comments and decisions
3. **Branch Strategy Insights**: Understand feature development patterns
4. **Merge Conflict Patterns**: Identify architectural friction points
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Link deployment success to code changes

---

## Implementation Priority

This should be added to the fitb CLI roadmap as a **Phase 2 enhancement** after core mock functionality is proven. The git integration provides real, high-signal data that moves the system from mock to production-ready.

### Suggested Timeline
- Week 3-4: Design git analysis module
- Week 5-6: Implement basic commit parsing
- Week 7-8: Integrate with 360SOT and pattern engine
- Week 9-10: Add predictive features and advanced queries
